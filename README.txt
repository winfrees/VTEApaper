Volumetric Tissue Exlporation and Analysis - V. 0.9.0... optimistically.

Installation:

Put VTC_-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar into ~/FIJI/Plugins folder or install Plugin in FIJI.  
Also install jfreechart(http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/1.%20JFreeChart/1.0.17/)
jcommons (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/3.%20JCommon/1.0.21/)
and jxlayer (http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.swinglabs/jxlayer/3.0.4)

jfreechart/jcommons is required for the charting functionality and jxlayer is required for supporting layers in Java 1.6.  Jxlayer
